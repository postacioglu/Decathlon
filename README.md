Decathlon

The task is to output an XML file with all athletes in ascending order of their places, containing all the input data plus total score and the place in the competition (in case of equal scores, athletes must share the places, e.g. 3-4 and 3-4 instead of 3 and 4). Input and output file names should be provided as parameters to the Java application at the startup. Application should ask for those parameters itself.
